        The purpose of this test is to ensure that inheritance from directives and abstract
        classes will work as expected. Note that there have been different issues:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          `Issue61Component` extends from the `Issue61BaseDirective`. Component is decorated
          with `@UntilDestroy()` but directive is not
        </li>
        <li>
          `Issue97Component` extends from the `Issue97Directive`. Directive is decorated with
          `@UntilDestroy()` but component is not
        </li>
      </ol>
